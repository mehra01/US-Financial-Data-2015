# 📊 Financial Data Classification Project

## 📌 Overview

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to financial datasets for classification and prediction. Using company financial indicators (e.g., revenue, expenses, growth ratios, and sector information), the model predicts the **Class label** (e.g., investment decision category).

The analysis and model training have been implemented in **Python** using a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Dataset

* **File:** `0c3f6faa-0118-4436-9053-dcce20c69a90.csv`
* **Rows:** Multiple companies’ financial records
* **Columns:** 225 features including:

  * Revenue, Revenue Growth
  * Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit
  * Operating Income, Interest Expense
  * Asset Growth, Debt Growth
  * Book Value per Share Growth
  * Sector, Price Variation
  * **Class** (Target variable)

The dataset provides rich financial indicators for building robust prediction models.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 11a9d18c-5bd9-46f0-9552-dca2bc0b92c1.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells step by step to:

   * Load and preprocess the dataset
   * Perform feature engineering
   * Train machine learning models
   * Evaluate performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)

3. Modify the notebook for experimentation with different algorithms.
